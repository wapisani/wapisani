## A lifelong learner with a passion for solving problems using computers.

Hi! My name is Will Pisani. My go-to programming languages are Python and Julia, but I am also skilled in BASH and R. I have some experience with SQL, C++, FORTRAN, and MATLAB. I am familiar with HTML and CSS; I coded most of my [website](https://will.pisani.me) from scratch with a template from [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp) as a base. 

Please check out my repositories!

### [public-pyprojects](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects)

These are my public Python projects. They include a [Soundrop royalty report generator](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/Soundrop) (pandas, matplotlib, HTML/CSS), command line [minesweeper](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/Minesweeper), a GUI [Wordle assistant/solver](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/Wordle_Solver) (PySimpleGUI), and a [web scraper](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/APoD_Scraper) for downloading Astronomy Picture of the Day (requests, bs4).

### [CompMatSciTools](https://github.com/wapisani/CompMatSciTools)
A collection of tools meant to make various tasks easier when performing computational materials science research with the open-source molecular dynamics (MD) code [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org). Note: This repo is missing a lot of my recent scripts. I'm in the process of adding them to the repo.

### [PhD](https://github.com/wapisani/PhD/tree/master)
This repository contains a portion of the many, many scripts I have written and data files I have generated over the length of my PhD at [Michigan Tech](https://mtu.edu).

### [Advent of Code (AoC)](https://github.com/wapisani/AoC)
Since 2020, I've enjoyed trying to solve the Christmas puzzles of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) with my friends.
