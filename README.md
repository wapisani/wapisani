## A lifelong learner with a passion for solving problems using computers.

Hi! My name is Will Pisani. My go-to programming languages are Python and Julia, but I am also skilled in BASH and R. I have some experience with SQL, C++, FORTRAN, and MATLAB. I am familiar with HTML and CSS; I coded most of my [website](https://will.pisani.me) from scratch with a template from [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp) as a base. 

Please check out my repositories!

### public-pyprojects

These are my public Python projects. They include a [Soundrop royalty report generator](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/Soundrop) (pandas, matplotlib, HTML/CSS), command line [minesweeper](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/Minesweeper), a GUI [Wordle assistant/solver](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/Wordle_Solver) (PySimpleGUI), and a [web scraper](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/APoD_Scraper) for downloading Astronomy Picture of the Day (requests, bs4).
